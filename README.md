# AQUA MANAGER APP

## Problem Statement
Aqua manager aims to revolutionize the pure water supply chain in Nigeria by developing a comprehensive app ecosystem, addressing the longstanding issues of accessibility, transparency, and financial efficiency.Â 
The challenge is to seamlessly connect individuals, supermarkets, and depots through a unified platform, ensuring reliable water delivery while navigating the complexities of the Nigerian logistics landscape. 
While Aqua Manager strives to optimize the end-to-end supply chain, it acknowledges the external factors that might pose challenges, emphasizing the need for adaptability and resilience in the face of ever-changing circumstances. 
The challenge is not just to create a technological solution but to forge a reliable and efficient network that can withstand the unique challenges of the Nigerian market and contribute to the accessibility and transparency of pure water distribution.
